## Kubernetes Operator for Interview Candidate Assessment

This section documents a Kubernetes Operator project used for assessing interview candidates. The operator demonstrates core Kubernetes extension patterns and best practices for managing custom resources and automated operations within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Overview

The Kubernetes Operator serves as a reference implementation for:
- Custom Resource Definition (CRD) design and implementation
- Operator pattern implementation in Kubernetes
- Controller logic and reconciliation loops
- Candidate evaluation criteria

### Key Components

- **Custom Resources**: Define domain-specific objects managed by the operator
- **Controllers**: Implement the business logic to manage operator lifecycle
- **Webhooks**: Validation and mutation of custom resources (if applicable)

### Use Cases

This operator is designed to assess candidate knowledge in:
- Kubernetes architecture and API concepts
- Go programming language
- Operator SDK/Frameworks
- Cloud-native application design
